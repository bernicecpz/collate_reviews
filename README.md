# Collate reviews via AppStore RSS Feed

## Technology Stack
- Shell-script
- AppStore RSS Feed
- jq

## Purpose
To experiment using shell-script to automate the process of retrieving reviews from AppStore for the respective application via AppStore RSS Feed for all the coutnry codes.

The next step is to use jq to do the necessary formatting to only retrieve the necessary reviews and perhaps also to tag based on keywords. The output will be saved into CSV format. 


The experiment has stopped and unlikely to continue in the near future. The codes are currently been archived.
